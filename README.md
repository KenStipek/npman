# Motivation

It is really common to accidently add the wrong NPM package to your package.json file because of a near names (E.G. 'amplify' and 'aws-amplify'). This tool aims to help with this problem by giving the user the ability to view the readme for the package within their termenal.

### Example

```
$ npman amplify
Amplify is a wrapper around the NodeJS http packages to help make calls easier.
It is modeled after AmplifyJS. The idea is that you can use this package on the
server side and AmplifyJS on the client side.
```
